# Image Edge detection using ACO

Image Edge detection using ACO is a software program that provides a web-based implementation of an adapted Ant System algorithm proposed by [Liu and Fang (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0030401815003946). With some enhancements to the process, it is able to process perfectly most images - from clear to noisy.
It has an accessible interface and is easy to use.

The online version is hosted by GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://alecsiv.github.io/image-edge-detection-aco/).

## Set up
The project uses the standard node package manager - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). Therefore NPM must be set up on the working machine to run the local server (please see [NPM Get Started](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)). 

Assuming NPM is installed, navigate to the project folder in the comand line interface.

After opening the project folder in the CLI, install the project dependencies: 

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Server
To run the local server, execute the start command:

```bash
npm run start
```
